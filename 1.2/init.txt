[Music]

in the second video we're going to look

at what's happening at the network's

edge

and we're starting at the network edge

well because that's what we're familiar

with

it's what we see it's what we use every

day

we're going to cover two topics here

we're going to start off by covering

access networks the access network is

the network that connects the edge

device 

those amazing edge devices that

we saw in the previous video

into the first hop router into the

larger internet

in some cases an access network connects

a network itself say a home network

into this larger internet and then we're

going to take a look at physical media

we'll take a look at the copper wires

the fiber the radio that's actually used

to

transmit bits from the input side of the

link to the output side of the link

now to get started let's remember the

broader context

well you see our graphical depiction of

a network over here on the right

in the last video we talked about all of

the amazing devices at the network edge

computers smartphone cars and cool home

and personal devices

we noted that these edge devices are

sometimes called hosts

because they host or run network

applications

a host might be a client that requests

and receives a service

or a server that provides a service and

we'll see in chapter two that

client and server have very precise

meanings in a networking context

in the last section we also talked just

a bit about access

networks and physical media and that's

what we're going to focus on

here in this section and we also talked

about the network core

the set of routers that are

interconnected to form a network

and we also talked about how these

individual administratively scoped

networks are interconnected

to form an internet and so that's the

big picture context that we're starting

with

so what we want to focus on here are

access networks it's the network that

connects

the end system the host the device into

the larger global

internet it's really that network that

connects this device

to its first hop router on a path from

source to destination

and we'll see that there are basically

three types of access networks

they're residential access networks

there are institutional access networks

that are operated by a company by an

educational institution

by a municipality and then there are

mobile access

networks that are operated by cellular

access carriers

and also wi-fi networks and as we're

talking about these three different

types of access networks you might want

to keep two things in mind

first what is the bit transmission rate

over that access that is

how fast is that network and also to

what degree must one user

share that network with other users

so let's start our discussion of access

networks close to home

well actually in our home by first

looking at cable access networks

as shown in this figure here in a cable

access network

i have comcast cable access for example

in my house

a physical cable connects multiple homes

to a single cable head end

over here on the right the signals to

and from these houses

are sent on the cable at different

frequencies signals sent at different

frequencies

don't interfere with each other sort of

just like fm radio

with fm different stations can transmit

on different frequencies and we tune

into the frequency that we want

cable access networks are based on the

same approach

known as frequency division multiplexing

or fdm

but there are only so many frequencies

and so cable users also

often have to share a frequency with

their neighbors

we'll cover cable access networks and

their standard known as

docsis when we get to chapter six for

now

relax the idea is to get the big picture

here and we'll save the details for

later

cable access networks are typically

asymmetric

meaning that they're designed to

transmit data faster in the downstream

direction

to the home rather than upstream from

the home

and this asymmetry reflects the fact

that we tend to be more consumers of

data than

producers of data typical cable

transmission rates

are 40 megabits per second up to 1.2

gigabits per second

in the downstream direction and 30 to

100 megabits per second

upstream transmission rate and of course

as the saying goes

your mileage may vary and of course your

modem will

often typically rate limit how fast you

can send and receive

basically you're getting what you pay

for and note again that the cable

network is a shared network

it really is just a shared wire that you

can see often strung up on the telephone

poles

this means that if you and your neighbor

are sharing a frequency on the shared

wire

and your neighbors blasting away

transmitting and receiving a lot of data

that may be eating into the amount of

data that you're able to send and

receive

the second major type of residential

access is what's known

as digital subscriber line dsl dsl

networks use the existing phone line

sometimes called a twisted pair because

there are two copper wires that are sort

of wound around each other

that used to or maybe still do carry

phone service to your home

these dsl wires connect you directly to

what's called a central office so you're

not sharing

transmission capacity or bandwidth with

your neighbors between yourself

and the central office now light cable

networks

dsl lines are also asymmetric with a 24

to 52 megabit per second downstream

transmission rate

and a three and a half to maybe 16

megabits per second dedicated

upstream transmission rate and these

transmission rates depend very strongly

on the distance between the central

office and your home

and indeed if you're too far away

generally more than about three miles

you can't actually do dsl to the central

office

and now let's take a look at the home

itself this is what a typical home

network might look like

there's a dsl or cable link coming in

from the local telco

or cable network and then there's a

cable or dsl

modem modulator demodulator on the house

end

of that link connected to the cable

modems a router that has both wired and

wireless links to devices within the

home now

these links are typically wired ethernet

that runs typically at 100 megabits or

gigabit per second

transmission rate and wi-fi which runs

at

tens or hundreds of megabits per second

often the router the modem

wi-fi and ethernet are all combined into

one box

and then of course we've got the home

devices themselves the hosts and the end

systems that we talked about earlier

since we've already mentioned wi-fi

networks in the context of home networks

let's take a look

at wireless networks first now all of

chapter 7

is going to be dedicated to wireless

networking so we're just going to look

at the big picture here

and one way to think about this is

there's basically two classes of

wireless networks

there are the local wireless networks

wi-fi

for example and then there are the wide

area networks corresponding to 3g

4g and soon 5g cellular networks

now for both the local case the local

wireless networks as well as the digital

cellular networks

there's an entity a base station an

access point

to which the end devices transmitting

data and receiving data

from well the first broad class of

wireless networks are known as

wi-fi or wireless lan wlan

networks we've already seen these in the

context of home networks but they're

also widely deployed within

municipalities

with companies and other institutions as

well

they tend to operate in the range of

about 10 to 100 meters

if you're lucky at 100 meters and they

operate at different speeds from 11 to

54 to 450

megabits per second these protocols are

actually standardized by the ieee

under the family of 802.11 protocols

they're not standardized by the ietf

the second broad class of networks are

the 3g

4g and soon 5g cellular networks

these networks are operated by the

mobile cellular

operators and they tend to have a

transmission distance measured in the

tens of kilometers and they can have

transmission rates anywhere from

one to ten to multiple tens of megabits

per second

per user and finally there are

enterprise networks

and we might think of some enterprise

networks sort of like home networks on

steroids an enterprise network could

have

a mix of ethernet wired ethernet and

wireless wifi links

and one difference from a home network

is that an enterprise network would

typically have

multiple switches and routers to handle

the large number of devices

that would be connected to that

enterprise network another type of

enterprise network

that doesn't look at all like a home

network are data center networks that

connect

massive numbers of servers to each other

and to the internet

at hundreds of gigabits per second we'll

cover data center networks in detail in

chapter 6.

well that's all we're going to say for

now about access networks and we're

going to come back to this

in great detail when we get to chapters

six and seven

for now you might wanna just think about

the physical media that we've been

talking about

the copper wires the fiber optics and

the radio links and we're gonna get to

that

in just a second but first i wanna say a

few words about

packets i've used the phrase packets of

data and we've talked about how

a sender sends a packet of data into the

access network

what does that really mean let's take a

look at this host

here which is sending data to a first

hop switch here

and consider it sending operation the

highest level

the host has some data it wants to send

say a large file

what does the host do well the host is

going to take the data it wants to send

and break it into smaller chunks of data

known as packets

and as we'll see in addition to the data

itself

it'll add some additional information to

each chunk of data in what's called a

packet header

a protocol will dictate exactly what

information is added

into this header a packet the data plus

the header will have a length of say

l bits typical value for l might be 1500

bytes

the host then transmits this l bit

packet into the access network

at some transmission rate r measured in

bits per second

and as we've already seen r varies from

one type of access network to another

we saw that using wired ethernet a host

can send it

gigabits per second but over a 3g or 4g

network it may be constrained to a few

megabits per second or less

r is best thought of as a link

transmission rate

but it's sometimes more informally

referred to as the link capacity or

the linked bandwidth if one wants to

send an l-bit packet

into a link at transmission rate r then

the amount of time it takes to send

those bits into the link

is the number of bits to send l divided

by the transmission rate

r and we'll come back to this later well

we're going to wrap up here by taking a

quick look at the physical

characteristics of different

transmission media

and but before doing so i wanted to say

just a quick word about

our depth of coverage here there are

tons of interesting topics

that we could cover here in terms of

modulation and coding

and things that have to do with the

physical transmission of

bits but there's only so much that we

can fit into a course and so here

we're going to go over this pretty

lightly if that's the kind of thing that

gets you really excited

you want to learn more should definitely

take another course and you should pick

up another book on this

we're going to be looking at the

physical characteristics of different

transmission media

at a rather high level we're going to be

concerned about

what are the bit loss characteristics

how do signals interfere what do

propagation delays look like

but we won't get down into the details

of how different physical transmission

media work

if you want to do that pick up some more

material you know

it's really a question of taste and this

is a course on networking

we're going to start from here and work

our way up okay

so here are some very basic facts about

physical media

remember what we want to do is send

digital bits over some physical media

from sender to receiver the physical

media could be what's called guided

media

that's some kind of physical wire or

cable may be made of copper or optical

fiber

or it could be over unguided media where

signals propagate

freely like radio or acoustical waves

twisted pair used to refer to the real

twisted pair of wires that carried

your grandparents telephone signals into

the house but now refers also

to ethernet or adsl and runs at

hundreds of megabits per second and

sometimes gigabits per second

they can be susceptible to

electromagnetic noise you've probably

seen ethernet cables like this in your

home or

office or school coaxial cable is used

to carry

cable network access into your home and

operates at hundreds of megabits per

second

old-fashioned ethernet actually used to

run over cables like this but

not for at least 20 years

fiber optics cable carry light pulses

and operate at hundreds of gigabits per

second and higher

and have very low error rates so in some

sense they're really ideal for

communication

but the transmitting and receiving

components tend to be more

expensive than that for traditional

copper wires

with a wireless link bits are modulated

onto a signal carried in some

frequency band in the electromagnetic

spectrum there's no physical wire

and transmissions tend to be broadcast

meaning that any device near the

transmitting device may be able to

receive the transmitted signals

and this obviously raises eavesdropping

and also interference concerns

wireless is a notoriously harsh

environment for transmitting

radio signals fade over distance

depending on the frequency

signals can be reflected off of objects

or blocked by objects

or at other frequencies they can just

pass right through objects like walls

they're subject to noise generated by

motors microwaves and other devices that

emit rf signal

so transmitting bits over wireless

requires a lot of work at the physical

layer

and that's why there are entire courses

devoted to this topic

there are many types of wireless links

that you're probably familiar with

we've already discussed wi-fi networks

that can transmit

at up to hundreds of megabits per second

maybe over

tens of meters distances 4g cellular

networks transmit data at rates of tens

of megabits per second

over distances of up to say 10 miles

many of you probably use bluetooth which

is used

as a cable replacement technology and

operates at relatively low data rates

say one or two megabits per second max

and over a relatively

short range usually not more than 5 or

10 meters

and here are other forms of wireless

networks there's terrestrial microwave

that operates

at tens of megabits per second point to

point

and that's about the same transmission

rate for satellites in the case of

satellites there's a noticeable

propagation delay that's the time from

when a bit

is sent at the sender to when it's

received at the receiver

a noticeable propagation delay of 270

milliseconds

between a sender or a receiver and a

geosynchronous satellite

well that wraps up our initial

discussion of what's happening at the

network edge

hopefully you've got a better high level

understanding now about access networks

and physical media next up we're heading

into the network core
