# network edge

## 知识点

**first hop router**：简称 **FHRP**。通常情况下，在终端装置进入网络前，都会有一个Router，用作第一个网络地址。若路由器异常或故障，终端设备就无法链接网络。为了应对这种情况，一般会考虑再加一台路由器作为备份。但此时，有两个路由器，怎么去联动呢？ **FHRP** 就是将多个路由器虚拟成一个路由器来提供服务。

**physical media**: 是指用于存储或传输数据通信中信息的物理材料 [详情](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_media)

**frequency division multiplexing**: 简称 fdm。一种多路复用技术。是一种将多路基带信号调制到不同频率载波上再进行叠加形成一个复合信号的多路复用技术 [详情](https://baike.baidu.com/item/FDM/16473889)


## 个人逐句翻译

in the second video we're going to look at what's happening at the network's edge

在第二个视频里我们将会看到 **network's edge** 怎么运行的。

and we're starting at the network edge well because that's what we're familiar with it's what we see it's what we use every day

我们从 **network edge** 开始说起，是因为我们都很熟悉它，并且每天都使用。

we're going to cover two topics here

我们将在这里讨论两个话题

we're going to start off by covering access networks 

我们将开始讨论 **access networks**

the access network is the network that connects the edge device

**access networks** 是通过 **edge device** 访问

those amazing edge devices that we saw in the previous video into the first hop router into the larger internet

我们上一个视频看到 **edge devices** 是通过 **first hop router** 进入larger internet

in some cases an access network connects a network itself say a home network into this larger internet and then we're going to take a look at physical media

在一些例子里，把自己本地的局域网络链接到更大的网络，叫做home work。 接下来我们看看这个**physical media**

we'll take a look at the copper wires the fiber the radio that's actually used to transmit bits from the input side of the link to the output side of the link

我们看看这铜线、这光纤、这无线电，它们把数据从这条链路的输入端传输到这条链路的输出端

now to get started let's remember the broader context

现在让我们看看这背景图

well you see our graphical depiction of a network over here on the right in the last video we talked about all of the amazing devices at the network edge

很好，你看看我们这个右手边的network描述图。我们讨论了很多关于network edge的信息

computers smartphone cars and cool home and personal devices

计算机、智能手机、汽车 、家庭、个人设备

we noted that these edge devices are sometimes called hosts because they host or run network applications

我们都知道这些**edge devices** 有时候被称为 hosts，是因为他们 host 或者 运行网络程序

a host might be a client that requests and receives a service or a server that provides a service

host 可能是一个 发出请求或者接收服务器返回的 clinet ，也可能是一个提供服务的server

and we'll see in chapter two that client and server have very precise meanings in a networking context

我们将会在 chapter two 看到 client 和 server 在network的具体作用

in the last section we also talked just a bit about access networks and physical media 

在最后部分，我们会说一点关于 access networks 和 physical media

and that's what we're going to focus on here 

接下来我们将会关注这里

in this section and we also talked about the network core

在这部分，我们会说一些关于 network core

the set of routers that are interconnected to form a network

互相连接形成的网络的一组路由器

and we also talked about how these individual administratively scoped networks are interconnected to form an internet

我们说一下 个人局部区域怎么互相连接行程一个网络

and so that's the big picture context that we're starting with

我们从这大图片开始

so what we want to focus on here are access networks 

我们要关注这里- access networks 

it's the network that connects the end system the host the device into the larger global internet

这是一个连接 系统、host、device 进入更大的 internet 的网络

it's really that network that connects this device to its first hop router on a path from source to destination


and we'll see that there are basically three types of access networks

我们看到有三种 access networks 的基本方式

they're residential access networks

住宅 access networks

there are institutional access networks that are operated by a company by an educational institution by a municipality 

机构 access networks，通过公司经营者，通过教育机构，通过市政府机构

and then there are mobile access networks that are operated by cellular access carriers

手机 access networks，通过蜂窝 access 运营商

and also wi-fi networks 

还有wi-fi networks

and as we're talking about these three different types of access networks

当我们说这三种不同的方式 access networks 时

you might want to keep two things in 

你们要把两件事记住

first what is the bit transmission rate over that access that is how fast is that network 

第一，bit 的传输速率是多少 和  网络速度有多块
 
and also to what degree must one user

share that network with other users

so let's start our discussion of access networks close to home

让我们来讨论家里附近的网络访问

well actually in our home by first

很好，通常在我们家附件，首先需要

looking at cable access networks as shown in this figure here in a cable access network

看图中的电缆接入

i have comcast cable access for example 

我有一个 comcast 接入例子

in my house

在我家

a physical cable connects multiple homes

一个电缆连接多个家庭

to a single cable head end over here on the right 

有图的单个电缆接头

the signals to and from these houses are sent on the cable at different frequencies 

这个信号在这些家庭电缆里以不同的频率来回

signals sent at different frequencies

信号是以不同的频率发送

don't interfere with each other sort of

不会互相干扰

just like fm radio

就像 fm 信号

with fm different stations can transmit on different frequencies

区别于fm的地方，就是 stations 能够传递不同频率

and we tune into the frequency that we want cable access networks are based on the same approach

我们调节频率是希望线缆能够以稳定的方式访问networks

known as frequency division multiplexing or fdm

称为 频分多路复用 或者 fdm

but there are only so many frequencies 

但是频率是有限的

and so cable users also often have to share a frequency with their neighbors

所以电缆拥有者通常都是与邻居们共享一个频率

we'll cover cable access networks and their standard known as docsis when we get to chapter six for

第六章将会讨论电缆访问网络和被称为 docsis 的标准

relax the idea is to get the big picture here and we'll save the details for later

cable access networks are typically asymmetric

电缆访问网络速度一般来说是不对称

meaning that they're designed to transmit data faster in the downstream direction

意思是他们设计下载传输数据很快

to the home rather than upstream from the home

家里下载速度比从家里上传快

and this asymmetry reflects the fact that we tend to be more consumers of data than producers of data

这种速度不对称反映一个事实：我们倾向于使用数据胜过生产数据

typical cable transmission rates are 40 megabits per second up to 1.2 gigabits per second in the downstream direction 

一般的电缆传输速度 在下载里 从 40mb/s 上升到 1.2g/s

and 30 to 100 megabits per second upstream transmission rate

在上传速度里，从30mb/s 到 100mb/s

and of course as the saying goes your mileage may vary

当然，你会觉得我说的速度与你的会有所不同

and of course your modem will often typically rate limit how fast you can send and receive

你的modem通常会限制你的收与发的速度

basically you're getting what you pay for and note again that the cable network is a shared network

取决于你所支付的套餐和要记得当前这个网络是共享网络

it really is just a shared wire that you can see often strung up on the telephone poles

它只是一个共享的线，你可以看到它们在电话线杆上

this means that if you and your neighbor are sharing a frequency on the shared wire and your neighbors blasting away transmitting and receiving a lot of data that may be eating into the amount of data that you're able to send and receive

如果你和你邻居在一条共享线上共享一个频率，并且你的邻居发送和接收大量数据，将会占用大量属于你的发送与接收的数据

the second major type of residential access is what's known as digital subscriber line dsl

第二种家居访问网络的主要类型叫：digital subscriber line，简称dsl

dsl networks use the existing phone line

dsl 网络主要是使用现存的电话线做传输媒介

sometimes called a twisted pair because there are two copper wires that are sort of wound around each other that used to or maybe still do carry phone service to your home

有时候被称为双绞线，是因为有两条铜线相互缠绕而成。你家里的固定电话可能还在使用着它

these dsl wires connect you directly to what's called a central office 

dsl线路直接连接到你的 central office

so you're not sharing transmission capacity or bandwidth with your neighbors between yourself 

所以你是不用与你邻居共享你的传输速度与带宽

and the central office now light cable networks

当前的central office 是光纤网络

dsl lines are also asymmetric with a 24 to 52 megabit per second downstream transmission rate and a three and a half to maybe 16 megabits per second dedicated upstream transmission rate

dsl线路的不对称数据是：24-52mb/s的下载传输速度，3.5-16mb/s的上传传输速度

and these transmission rates depend very strongly on the distance between the central office
and your home

这些传输速度非常依赖于central office 与你家里的距离

and indeed if you're too far away 

如果你确实距离很远

generally more than about three miles you can't actually do dsl to the central office

通常超过3英里你就不能用dsl连接到central office

and now let's take a look at the home itself

现在我们看看家

this is what a typical home network might look like

这看起来是一个典型的家庭网络

there's a dsl or cable link coming in from the local telco or cable network 

这里是 dsl 或者 电缆 来自于当地 telco 或者 电缆网络

and then there's a cable or dsl modem modulator demodulator on the house

这里有个 cable 或 dsl 的调制解调器 在房子里

end of that link connected to the cable modems a router that has both wired and wireless links to devices within the home now

这个链路的终端连接着一个拥有有线与无线功能的调制解调器

these links are typically wired ethernet that runs typically at 100 megabits or gigabit per second transmission rate and wi-fi which runs at tens or hundreds of megabits per second

这些链路通常都是有线 ethernet ,支持 100mb/s or 100g/s 传输速度，wifi支持10-100mb/s传输速度

often the router the modem wi-fi and ethernet are all combined into one box

通常这些路由、modem、wifi、ethernet 都被组装成一个盒子

and then of course we've got the home devices themselves the hosts

我们的家用设备本身就是 hosts

and the end systems that we talked about earlier

我们之前谈到的终端系统也是

since we've already mentioned wi-fi networks in the context of home networks

我们之前在家庭网络里面提及了wi-fi网络

let's take a look at wireless networks first now all of chapter 7 is going to be dedicated to wireless networking so we're just going to look at the big picture here

让我们看看chapter 7 的无线网络，它讲述无线网络，我们现在看看这个大图

and one way to think about this is

there's basically two classes of wireless networks

有两种类型的无线网络

there are the local wireless networks wi-fi

有本地无线网络与 wi-fi

for example and then there are the wide area networks corresponding to 3g 4g and soon 5g cellular networks

例如 广域网的 3g 4g 5g蜂窝网络

now for both the local case 

the local wireless networks as well as the digital cellular networks

本地无线网络一般称为数字蜂窝网络

there's an entity a base station an access point to which the end devices transmitting
data and receiving data

一个实体的基站作为入口处理数据的传输与接收

from well the first broad class of wireless networks are known as wi-fi or wireless lan wlan
networks 

第一个类别的无线网络叫做wi-fi 或者 无线局域网

we've already seen these in the context of home networks but they're also widely deployed within municipalities with companies and other institutions 

我们已经在家庭网里面看到它了，但是它广发应用于公司或机构

as well they tend to operate in the range of about 10 to 100 meters

它比较适合10-100米范围内的局域网

if you're lucky at 100 meters and they operate at different speeds from 11 to 54 to 450 megabits per second 

如果你幸运的在100米，它的传输速度可能不稳定，11 到 54 到350 mb/s 不等

these protocols are actually standardized by the ieee under the family of 802.11 protocols

这些协议是通过ieee组织在802.11协议族下标准化的

they're not standardized by the ietf

它没有被ietf组织纳入标准

the second broad class of networks are the 3g 4g and soon 5g cellular networks

第二个类别的无线网络是3g,4g,5g蜂窝网络

these networks are operated by the mobile cellular operators 

这是网络由手机运营商运营

and they tend to have a transmission distance measured in the tens of kilometers 

它适合于传送范围为方圆几十公里距离的

and they can have transmission rates anywhere from one to ten to multiple tens of megabits
per second

它能够传输速度可以从一到十或者几十mb/s

per user and finally there are enterprise networks

每个人都会有企业网络

and we might think of some enterprise networks sort of like home networks on steroids 

<!-- 我们认为一些企业网络有点像家庭网络 -->

an enterprise network could have a mix of ethernet wired

一个企业网络与有线以太网混合而成的网络

wired ethernet and wireless wifi links

有线以太网与无线wifi组成的链路

and one difference from a home network is that an enterprise network would typically have
multiple switches and routers to handle the large number of devices that would be connected to that enterprise network another 

与家庭网络不同的一个点是企业网络通常能够有多个交换机与路由器去handle企业内部连接的大量设备

type of enterprise network that doesn't look at all like a home network are data center networks that connect massive numbers of servers to each other

企业网络与家庭网络完全不同的一点是：企业网络内部的连接是大量服务器的互联

and to the internet at hundreds  of gigabits per second we'll cover data center networks in detail in chapter 6.

在 数百万g/s 的 internet环境中，我们将会在 chapter 6详细讨论数据网络中心 

well that's all we're going to say for now about access networks 

这就是我想要说的关于接入网络的东西

and we're going to come back to this

现在我们回到这里

in great detail when we get to chapters six and seven

for now you might wanna just think about the physical media that we've been talking about the copper wires the fiber optics and the radio links and we're gonna get to that

现在我们像讨论一下物理传输媒介，我们已经说了关于电缆、光纤、无线电

in just a second but first i wanna say a few words about packets 

等一下，我第一想说的是数据包

i've used the phrase packets of data 

and we've talked about how a sender sends a packet of data into the access network

我们已经讨论了 发送方怎么去发送一个数据包到网络里

what does that really mean 

let's take a look at this host

让我们看看这个host

here which is sending data to a first hop switch here

and consider it sending operation the highest level

the host has some data it wants to send say a large file

主机要发送一些数据，例如一份大文件

what does the host do 

主机会怎么做

well the host is going to take the data it wants to send and break it into smaller chunks of data

主机将会把发送的数据切开放入一个个小小的chunks data

known as packets

称作：packets

and as we'll see in addition to the data itself

it'll add some additional information to each chunk of data in what's called a packet header

它会增加一下额外参数到每一个chunk data 中，叫做 数据头

a protocol will dictate exactly what information is added into this header 

一个协议规定了什么信息能够加入到这个头中

a packet the data plus the header will have a length of say l bits typical value for l might be 1500 bytes

数据加上header数据的数据包会有一个长度，用 l bits表示, 一般长度为1500bytes/包

the host then transmits this l bit packet into the access network

服务器在网络里传输这个l长度的packet

at some transmission rate r measured in bits per second

在一个传输速度为 r bits/s 里

and as we've already seen r varies from one type of access network to another

我们已经看到用 r 的速度 从一种网络到另一种网络的变化

we saw that using wired ethernet a host can send it gigabits per second but over a 3g or 4g network it may be constrained to a few megabits per second or less r is best 

我们看到使用有线以太网的服务器发送的速度是以 g/s 计算，但是 3g 或者 4g 网络，它可能被约束到 mb/s 或者比 r的速度更低

thought of as a link transmission rate but it's sometimes more informally referred to as the link capacity or the linked bandwidth 

这就是链路传输的速度，但是有时候这情况被称为链路容量或者链路的带宽

if one wants to send an l-bit packet into a link 

发送 l bit 的packet 到一个链路上

at transmission rate r then the amount of time 

在传输过程速度为r的角度上看，这就是它的单位是时间量

it takes to send those bits into the link is the number of bits to send l divided by the transmission rate r

它 发送这些 bits 进入链路的数据量总数 l  除以 传输速率 r

and we'll come back to this later well

我们回到这里一会

we're going to wrap up here by taking a quick look at the physical characteristics of different transmission media

我快速浏览一遍不同传输介质的物理特性

and but before doing so i wanted to say just a quick word about our depth of coverage here

在这之前我想简短说一些内部的事情

there are tons of interesting topics that we could cover here in terms of modulation and coding and things that have to do with the physical transmission of bits 

有一些有趣的关于 调制 和 coding 和 bit在物理传输上有关的事情

but there's only so much that we can fit into a course 

and so here we're going to go over this pretty lightly 

if that's the kind of thing that gets you really excited

如果这些事情让你很兴奋

you want to learn more should definitely take another course 

你想要学习更多，确实需要另一个课程

and you should pick up another book on this

你应该拿起另一本书

we're going to be looking at the physical characteristics of different
transmission media

我们将要看看不同传输介质的物理特性

at a rather high level we're going to be concerned about what are the bit loss characteristics

在更高的层级上，我们将要考虑bit的损耗原因

how do signals interfere what do propagation delays look like

怎样看待信号干扰导致传输延迟

but we won't get down into the details of how different physical transmission media work

但是我们不会深入不同物理介质传输工作中的细节

if you want to do that pick up some more material 

如果你想深入了解，应该拿起更多的物理学科知识

you know

it's really a question of taste and this is a course on networking

这是一个很有品味的问题，但是这是一个 networking课程

we're going to start from here and work our way up 

我们将从这里开始

okay

so here are some very basic facts about physical media

这里有很多关于物理介质的基本事例

remember what we want to do is send digital bits over some physical media

要记得我们现在要做的是物理介质传输数字数据

from sender to receiver the physical media could be what's called guided media

发送与接收的物理介质都被称为导体介质

that's some kind of physical wire or cable may be made of copper or optical fiber or it could be over unguided media 

一些有线介质或者电缆可能由铜线、光纤或本身组成，也可能是非导体介质外

where signals propagate freely like radio or acoustical waves

信号的传播就像无线电和声波

twisted pair used to refer to the real

twisted pair of wires that carried

your grandparents telephone signals into the house 

你祖母手机信号在家里

but now refers also to ethernet or adsl and runs at hundreds of megabits per second and sometimes gigabits per second

但是现在以太网或者adsl运行速率是 数百mb/s 和 千兆/s 上

they can be susceptible to electromagnetic noise 

它会收到电磁噪声影响

you've probably seen ethernet cables like this in your home or office or school coaxial cable is used to carry

你可能在家里、办公室、学校看到以太网的电缆是用同轴电缆覆盖的

cable network access into your home and operates at hundreds of megabits per second

电缆家庭接入速率是 数百mb/s

old-fashioned ethernet actually used to run over cables like this 

老得以太网电缆就是在这种电缆上运行的

but not for at least 20 years

不过是20年前的事情了

fiber optics cable carry light pulses and operate at hundreds of gigabits per second and higher and have very low error rates 

光纤电缆使用的是光脉冲，传输速率能达到数百千兆/s 甚至更高，并且有更低的错误率

so in some sense they're really ideal for communication

在某种意义上来说，它更适合用在传输上

but the transmitting and receiving components tend to be more
expensive than that for traditional copper wires with a wireless link bits are modulated
onto a signal carried 

但是发射和接收组件比传统的电缆调解器和无线调节器贵

in some frequency band in the electromagnetic spectru there's no physical wire and transmissions tend to be broadcast

在一些频率上，是没有能够承载的物理传输介质,所以在传输上倾向于广播方式

meaning that any device near the transmitting device may be able to receive the transmitted signals

意味着 发射设备附近任意设备都能接受传输信号

and this obviously raises eavesdropping and also interference concerns

这种现象会引起窃听、干扰的问题

wireless is a notoriously harsh environment for transmitting radio signals fade over distance
depending on the frequency

wireless 传输无线信号 是对周围环境要求很严格的，并且随着距离的远近而信号衰减的距离取决于频率的高低

signals can be reflected off of objects or blocked by objects or at other frequencies they can just pass right through objects like walls

无线信号能够被物体发射 或者物体阻挡 或者部分频率拥有穿透特性，例如穿墙

they're subject to noise generated by motors microwaves and other devices that emit rf signal

无线信号会受到 微波炉、其他设备的射频信号噪音影响

so transmitting bits over wireless requires a lot of work at the physical layer

所以无线传输的要求大大超过物理介质传输层面

and that's why there are entire courses devoted to this topic

这就是为什么有针对这个主题的课程原因

there are many types of wireless links that you're probably familiar with

这里有很多关于无线的links，你们可能会有兴趣

we've already discussed wi-fi networks that can transmit at up to hundreds of megabits per second

我们已经讨论了wi-fi网络，它能够传输数百mb/s

maybe over tens of meters distances 4g cellular networks transmit data at rates of tens
of megabits per second over distances of up to say 10 miles


many of you probably use bluetooth which is used

可能你使用过 bluetooth

as a cable replacement technology and operates at relatively low data rates

作为电缆的替代技术，它的传输数据速率比较低

say one or two megabits per second max

1-2mb/s

and over a relatively short range usually not more than 5 or 10 meters

传输范围相对比较小，不超过5-10米

and here are other forms of wireless networks 

这里有其他形式的无线网络

there's terrestrial microwave that operates at tens of megabits per second point to
point

这是 地面微波信号，倾向于点对点传输，速率 10mb/s

and that's about the same transmission rate for satellites in the case of
satellites 

与卫星的传输速率大致相同

there's a noticeable propagation delay that's the time from

它有个明显的传播延迟

when a bit is sent at the sender to when it's received at the receiver
a noticeable propagation delay of 270 milliseconds between a sender or a receiver and a
geosynchronous satellite

well that wraps up our initial

discussion of what's happening at the network edge

hopefully you've got a better high level

understanding now about access networks

and physical media next up we're heading into the network core
